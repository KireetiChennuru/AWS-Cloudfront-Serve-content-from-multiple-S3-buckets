**Project Report:** AWS CloudFront Serve Content From Multiple S3 Buckets

**Introduction:**
This project aimed to set up a content delivery network using AWS CloudFront, serving content from multiple S3 buckets. The project involved creating AWS S3 buckets, configuring CloudFront distributions, setting up error pages, region-wise access restrictions, and implementing URL invalidations.

**Course Objectives:**
1.	Create AWS S3 buckets
2.	Create AWS CloudFront distribution
3.	Setup error pages & region-wise access restrictions

**Project Structure:**
Task 1: Create S3 buckets
1.  Created multiple S3 buckets to store content for the CloudFront distribution.
Task 2: Create a CloudFront distribution
•	Configured CloudFront distribution to serve content from S3 buckets.
Task 3: Update origins & behaviors
•	Configured origins and behaviors to map S3 buckets with CloudFront distribution effectively.
Task 4: Setup error page
•	Implemented custom error pages to handle errors gracefully.
Task 5: Setup URL invalidations
•	Configured URL invalidations to ensure updated content delivery.
Task 6: Setup restrictions & Terminate
•	Implemented region-wise access restrictions for enhanced security.
•	Reviewed and finalized the setup, ensuring all components were properly configured.

Conclusion:
This project provided hands-on experience in setting up a scalable content delivery network using AWS services. Through the completion of tasks ranging from bucket creation to access restrictions, I gained proficiency in configuring CloudFront distributions for efficient content delivery.
